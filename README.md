## LibDriver CH9121

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/ch9121/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

CH9121 is a chip realizing transparent transmission between network and UART. It integrates TCP/IP protocol stack, which can realize bidirectional transparent transmission between network data packets and serial data. It has 4 working modes: TCP CLIENT, TCP SERVER, UDP CLIENT and UDP SERVER. The serial baud rate can be up to 921600bps. It can be easily configured by upper computer software or serial commands, which is convenient and quick.

LibDriver CH9121 is the full function driver of CH9121 launched by LibDriver.It provides tcp server, tcp client, udp server, udp client and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver CH9121 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver CH9121 UART platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver CH9121 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver CH9121 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver CH9121 offline document.

/datasheet includes CH9121 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface UART platform independent template and finish your platform UART driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_ch9121_basic.h"

char data[49];
uint16_t l;
uint8_t dest_ip[4] = {192, 168, 1, 10};
uint16_t dest_port = 1000;
uint8_t gateway[4] = {192, 168, 1, 1};
uint8_t mask[4] = {255, 255, 255, 0};
ch9121_mode_t mode = CH9121_MODE_TCP_CLIENT;
uint8_t source_ip[4] = {192, 168, 1, 230};
uint16_t source_port = 2000;
ch9121_port_t uart_port = CH9121_PORT1;

/* net init */

    return 1;
}

...

/* 48 byte */
l = 48;
memset(data, 0, sizeof(char) * 48);

/* net read */
if (ch9121_basic_read((uint8_t *)data, &l) != 0)
{
    (void)ch9121_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

/* output */
ch9121_interface_debug_print("ch9121: net read %s.\n", data);

...
    
/* net deinit */
if (ch9121_basic_deinit() != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

return 0;
